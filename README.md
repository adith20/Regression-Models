# Regression-Models
Linear and Logistic Regression models are implemented without use of sckitlearn package. The Models were built and executed in PyCharm, version - Python 3.8 .
## Linear Regression
The dataset used is crash.txt. Linear Regression is used here to predict time in ms after crash by analyzing acceleration on the head.
## Logistic Regression
In logistic regression for iris dataset , Binomial classification was performed for the 3 pairs of classes, namely setosa & veriscolor, veriscolor & virginica and setosa & virginica. The overall Accuracy of the model was obtained by calculating the avg accuracy of the 3 models.
